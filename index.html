    <h2>Neymar JR</h2>
    <br />
    <p>
        Neymar is a Brazilian footballer who plays for Brazil national team and
      the French club ‘Paris Saint-Germain.’ He is known as one of the world’s
      leading footballers. Neymar, like many other football players in Brazil,
      started off as a street footballer. But his father, who had played
      professional football, helped him in taking the game seriously so that he
      could become a professional. Neymar joined the youth ranks at ‘FC Santos’
      when he was only 11 years old. In fact he was accepted into the youth
      program of the popular Spanish club ‘Real Madrid’ but he decided to stay
      back in Brazil after he was offered a higher pay. Throughout his time at
      ‘Santos,’ Neymar scored one spectacular goal after another, and his skills
      became the talk of the town. As a result, the biggest clubs in the world
      vied with each other to sign him. In 2013, he signed with ‘Barcelona’ and
      immediately made an impact before finally winning the treble for the
      Catalan club in 2015. During the course of his career, Neymar went on to
      become a prominent player for the Brazilian national team and helped his
      team reach the semi-final of the 2014 ‘World Cup’ which was held in
      Brazil. Neymar is without a doubt one of the leading footballers in the
      world and is all set to become one of the greatest footballers of his
      generation
