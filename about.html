   Neymar
  is a Brazilian footballer who plays for Brazil national team 
  and the French club ‘Paris Saint-Germain.’ He is known as one
  of the world’s leading footballers. Neymar, like many other
  football players in Brazil,started off as a street footballer.
  But his father, who had played professional football, helped 
  him in taking the game seriously so that hecould become a 
  professional. Neymar joined the youth ranks at ‘FC Santos’when
  he was only 11 years old. In fact he was accepted into the youth
  program of the popular Spanish club ‘Real Madrid’ but he decided
  to stay back in Brazil after he was offered a higher pay.
  Throughout his time at‘Santos,’ Neymar scored one spectacular
  goal after another, and his skills became the talk of the town.
  As a result, the biggest clubs in the world vied with each other
  to sign him. In 2013, he signed with ‘Barcelona’ and immediately
  made an impact before finally winning the treble for the Catalan
  club in 2015. During the course of his career, Neymar went on to
  become a prominent player for the Brazilian national team and helped
  his team reach the semi-final of the 2014 ‘World Cup’ which was held
  in Brazil. Neymar is without a doubt one of the leading footballers in
  the world and is all set to become one of the greatest footballers of
   his generation.
